# Minecraft Jigsaw Preview

This tool lets you preview and debug minecraft jigsaw structures. Simply open a configured structure feature file of type ```minecraft:village```, ```minecraft:pillager_outpost``` or ```minecraft:bastion_remnant```. You can use the arrow buttons on the bottom or the left/right arrow keys to to step through the generation process. 

### Bounding Boxes
- Blue: Currently generated structure
- Green: Generating inside of this structure
- Red: Other structures that can't intersect

Note that "inside" is defined loosly in y axis for villages.
